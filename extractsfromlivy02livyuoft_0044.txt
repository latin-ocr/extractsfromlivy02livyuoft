26 NOTES ON llANNsBAL’S CAMPAIGM

II. BATTLE OF THE TREBIA, B. C. 218.

AFTER the engagement near Ictumulae Scipio broke up his camp,
retired over the Ticinus through the plain to the bridge over the Po, and
crossed the river with all speed. He recognized the superiority of Han·
nibal's cavalry, for which the country was admirably adapted, being
a wide plain ; he had also received a severe wound in the engagement.
It was necessary to place his forces in a secure position ; and with this
object he proceeded along the south bank of the Po to Placentia, a
Roman colony (Polyb. iii. 66).

Meanwhile Hannibal remained for a short time in his position expect-
ing that Scipio would attack him with his infantry, but when he found
that the Romans had abandoned their camp he advaneed to the Ticinus.
Here he seized the bridge, by which Scipio had crossed, in time to save
it from destruction, and also cut off 600 men who had been lest to
defend it. But on hearing that the rest of the Roman force were far in
advanee, he changed the direction of his march, and having reached the
Po, marched up the north bank of the stream in the hope of finding
a place where the river could be erossed. On the second day (aster
leaving his camp) he halted, and having thrown a bridge of boats
across the stream, left Hasdrubal to superintend the passage of the main
body of the army, at once erossed the river, and entered into negotiations
with envoys srom the neighbouring places who, aster this success, were
ready to join him. When the army had accomplished the passage he
joined it, ancl led it dowt. the river on the south bank, seeking an en-
gagement with the enemy. On the next day he found himself in the
neighbourhood of Scipio at Placentia3 and on the third day he drew out
his forces in sight of the Romans, but as no one came out to meet him,
he went into camp about fifty stades (six miles) from the Romana
(Polyb. iii. 66. Unfortunately Polybius has not stated whether Hannibal
did or did not cross the Trebia. Placentia was on the east bank of the
river, so we should suppose that Scipio would not put the river between
himself and the town when seeking the shelter of it. But z'fScz'ffl'o z's on
tlte east bank of the Trebia, Hannibal is so also.)

In the following night the Gauls who were in the Roman camp
attacked the Romans who were nearest to them, and having killed a con-
siderable number, cut off their headS, and went over to Hannibal (2000
infantry and nearly 200 horse). This alarmed Scipio, who reflected
that the Gauls in the neighbourhood would now inevitably take the
