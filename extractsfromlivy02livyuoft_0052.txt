1. 171. veru, ‘ a javelin? So ‘ Volscosque verutos‚' ‘ armed with jave-

lius} Verg. Georg. 2. 168.

avertere, ‘forced them to turn, and as soon as they turned, fol·
lowed close up and stabbed them under the tail, where the tenderness
of their skin specially admits of wounds.’

1. 174. consternatos in, lit. ‘excited against! Translate, ‘ When
Hannibal saw them thus affrighted, and rushing wildly against their own
side, he ordered them to be driven from the centre to the flanks to the lest
wing upon our Gallie auxiliary forees.’ Note the position of the subject
‘ Hannibal) which is rendered necessary by the prominence given to the
object, which has to come as near as possible to the previous sentence.

l. 176. extemplo, adverb formed from preposition and case. So too
‘ cora1n,' 6111κ;ο,’ ‘ cominus,’ &c.

1. 189. aliis. ‘ Some few, for sear of the enemy, were the more bold
to take to the river, and being once over, recovered their camp.'

1. 192. prope omnes. Polybius tells us ‘all but one.¹ He omits,
however, to tell us what happened to the two consuls, and passes on to
the next year's appointment without mention of Scipio's removal of his
camp, or of Sempronius' holding the election. This is just the kind of
accuracy which Livy is able to supply. In military details it is better to
