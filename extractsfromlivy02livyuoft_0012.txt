viii mTR OD UCTION.

The victorious march os Napolcon aster Montenotte. the passages os the
Po at Pincenza and οἰ the Adda at Loth, remind us os the advanee οἱ
Hannibal, while the wary and astute policy with which they were met
by Wurmser may seem to be a repetition os the usesul cantion displayed
by Fabius the Delaycr.

But here the parallel stops. The conditions of the attack were quite
different as sar as politics were conoerned. Hannibal was attacking
a youthsul aristocracy. whose only wcakness was that they put politics
above military success, so that they had to be srightened into victory.
Napoleon was attacking ι set os states so diverse that he himself
believed that both geography and genealogy intended them to be
always apart.

But Napoleon could afford to wait; Hannibal could not. Napoleon
led an army of enthusiasts, Hannibal an army os mercenaria. Napoleon
in his earlier years had at bis back a govemment which trusted him:
Hannibal knew that is he could not organize an insurrection against
Rome in Italy itsels, he must fail.

As Amold has well said, the man who struggles against the nation
must eventually sail. As soon as Napoleon represented only himself,
his work fell to pieces.

The very greatness of the barriers which nature had erected sor the
protection of Italy seems to have invited invasion.. Hannibal took the
Alps by storm. Napoleon the Great turned their flank. Napoleon the
Third, with more lasting effect, flooded Italy with troops both through
the passes and round by sea.
