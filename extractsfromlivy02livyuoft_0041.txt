I. ENGAGEMENT ΟΝ THE TJCJNUS. 23

in, with accusative, represents the aim, the object of effort‚ ‘towards
the hope-³ In English we say ‘in hope.'

1. 14. esse. Note the omission of the verb on which this depends.
We must supply ‘ saying.'

l. 15. vel-it, for ‘vellet.’ The leading verb is ‘ p1·onuntiat.' In oratio
obliqua the historic present may be treated as au actual present or
as a past. Sometimes, as here, both constructions are intermixed.
Compare Caesar, B. G. i. 7, ‘ Helvetii legatos mittunt, qui dicerent sibi
in animo esse iter facere; rogare ut liceat.’ This is, however, not to
be imitated.

immunem, ‘ as a freehold, without service, for himself and for his
heirs for ever.’

1. 16. ipse, nnlike ‘ idem,‘ which is equally derived from ‘ is‚’ is
declined in the second syllable. The ‘ -pse' is originally an indeclinable
affix, like -ποτε, assimilated from ‘ -pte ' (‘ ispte ’).

l. 17. maluisset, ‘if any one chose to have money rather than land,
him he would satisfy with coins Note how entirely ‘pecunia’ has
here lost its original meaning of ‘ property in stock.' For the form
‘ maluisset' compare note on ‘ala,' line 4. The Roman rapidity of pro-
nunciation is applied to compound as well as simple words. Thus
‘ non volo’ becomes ‘ nolo‚’ ‘ scire licet' is made into ⁵ seilicet!

sociorum, ‘ such of the allies as might wish to become citizens of
Carthage, he would give them the opportunity.’ So ‘ facio mei potesta-
tem,' means, ‘I allow others to have access to me.' Hannibal here is
taking upon himself what no Roman general in those days would have
dared to promise. But the citizen of Carthage had a very slight amount
os practical influence. He had a right to vote or rather to sell his vote
in the elections to the Gerusia, or twenty-eight elders; he could vote
‘ aye’ on questions which the Gerusia had decided; but the idea of free
‘ comitia ' was unknown.

l. 21. quoque, ‘ further, to the slaves who had attended their masters
he offers freedom, and promiseS, in lieu of every slave so liberated, to
give the master two slaves from the captives taken in war.‘

mancipium, a purchased slave, as opposed to one reared on the
estate. ‘Manu capere' was the symbolos accepting a sale. In this
case Hannibal would have sold the captives into slavery, buthe offers
to present them to the masters whose slaves he had freed.

1. 22. reddo, here, as often, not of restoring, but of giving what is
due. So ‘ reddere votum.'

1. 23· rata.. ‘Ratus‚' the participle of ⁵ reor‚’ is used both passively
and deponently. Here it means ⁶ realized.'
