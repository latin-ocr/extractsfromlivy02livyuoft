JV. THE BA TTLE OF CANNAE. ⁷ 41

the usual rule was departed srom, by which the consul named the
dictator, and the dictator the master of horse, and both were elected
by the people (‘ quod nunquam antea factum‚’ Livy, l. c.). Mean-
while on swept the torrent of Hannibal's invading army, over the
rich plains of Spoletum‚ over the rich pastures where fed the oxen of the
Clitumnus, ‘ dear to the herdsman,’ along the left bank of the Tiber‚ on
the road towards the Allia, replete with such glorious memories to
the Gauls, swelling into a mighty flood, and threatening to submerge
the little rock on which were gathered the traditions of Rome. But
Hannibal knew better; his was not a mind which could become
intoxicated with success: he knew that no mere army could conquer
Rome, and waited till he could effect some political combination.
Meantime he would march to the South‚ where Rome had hardly yet
had time to weld her different subjects into Roman unity. Striking‚
therefore, across the Apenninos, he marehed towards the Adriatic,
and, when followed by Fabius, endeavoured to provoke that cautious
old soldier to battle by devastating the Samnite and Apulian territory.
And so the year wore to a close, Fabius withstanding, with equa] firm-
ness, the attacks of his political enemies at home, who called him
Hannibal's lackey, and the provoking sallies of Hannibal's cavalry, and
justisying the title (Virg. Aen. 6. 846) :—
‘ Unus qui nobis cunctando restituit rem‚’

which he has kept in all history. The next year found the reins of
govemment in the hands of two very different men, Lucius Aemilius
‹ Paulus, the hero of Illyria, and M. Terentius Varro. These consuls,
as usual, being elected for the year, felt they must do something.
The city was in very much the same position as Athens during the
first years of the Peloponnesian VVar, with this aggravation, that all
the Romans whom Hannibal seized were instantly put to death. The
yeomen of the Roman territory no doubt blamed the mercantile party
sor having provoked such an implacable enemy by their greed. But
of this we have no record; the struggle between the aristocrats and
popular party sor the distribution of the Ager Publicus throws all other
divisions into the shade, till even this disappears for some time under the
stern determination of all parties to combine to preserve the unity of Italy.

and consequently the Romans were obliged either to retreat nearer their
supplies or to offer battle. Their army amounted to 80,000. Cannae was
on the Aufidus, the only river which, rising on the west of the Apennines,
runs into the sea ou the east.
