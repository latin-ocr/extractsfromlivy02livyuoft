JV. THE BATTLE oF CANNAE. ’ 45

‘nitentes’ is made to agree with ‘amnis' and ‘acies' In this latter
case ‘nitentes’ would be used by a kind of zeugma with ‘amnis' as
well as ‘ acies.’ In Madvig's reading, however, there is a full stop after
‘claudebant‚‘ and the sense proceeds, ‘As the equites were struggling
on straightforwards from both Roman and Carthaginian lines, when
the horses at last came to a halt‚' &c. Compare the sham-fight in
Virg. Aen. 5. Polybius says οὐ γὰρ ἣν κατὰ νόμους ἐξ ἀναστροφῆς καὶ
μεταβολῆς ὁ κίνδυνος.

stantibus, ‘ at last, when their horses were brought to a stand-
still and wedged together by the mass, every man began to clasp his
enemy and drag him from his horse?

l. 405. The cavalry of the Romans on the right are thus defeated by
the Gauls and Spaniards under Hasdrubal.

l. 407. acrius, ‘the conflict was rather sharp than long.’ A com-
parison of two qualities found in the same action in unequal degrees is
denoted either by the positive with ‘ magis,’ or by two comparatu-es,
as ‘ Triumphus Camilli clarior erat quam gratior.'

1. 408. sub, ‘ immediately following.’

l. 410. par, dum. So Madvig reads for ‘parum,’ which is simply
nonsense. Translate, ‘At first even enough both in strength and spirit,
so long as the ranks of the Gauls and Spaniards kept together!

l. 411. connisi, obliqua.. Here again Madvig has come to the
rescae, and having ‘ consilioque‘ in the text, suggests, instead of ‘ aequa,'
which Gronovius read, and which would be a queer way of breaking up
. a crescent, ‘ connisi obliqua.' Translate, ‘After long and repeated efforts
they formed themselves into a sloping wedge and packed closer their
lines of attack, and so drove the crescent of the enemy, which was
ranged very thin and so the weaker, and somewhat advanced from the
rest of the battle.' Dr. Arnold compares the Roman advance to that
of the English at Fontenoy. They had acted as if the Gauls and
Spaniards were the whole centre, and by packing their columns of
advance too close had allowed themselves to be overlapped on either
side by the Africans. They were therefore doomed to victory and
failnre, much in the same way as the Greeks at Cunaxa. The Persians
at Marathon were defeated in a similar manner. They broke the Greek
centre, but their wings were repulsed by the Greeks, who then closed
upon the centre. Livy in saying nimis tenuem hardly gives Hannibal
as much credit for foresight as he deserves.

l. 414. institere. So Madvig, for ‘ insistere? The historic infinitive
cannot be used between two finite verbs in close connection.

tenore uno, ‘ without a break.'
