IV. THE BATTLE OF CANA'AE. 47

the Roman centre. This last charge is decisive. The cavalry in fact
beat the legions.

1. 449. parte altera. Paulus had been in command of the Roman right.

l. 451. confertis, ‘ keeping his men in close array.'

1. 453. et, ‘even for sitting his horse.'

1. 455. quam mallem, ‘he might as well have handed them over
to me ready bound ;' it is very good of him to have done what he
has, but I had rather he had gone a little way further and bound
them ready.

1. 457. quale, like Greek οἶος, used with its own verb omitted, ‘in
fact the fight on foot of the horsemen was such as you would expect
where victory was no longer to be hoped, for the conquered chose
rather to die where they stood than to fly, and the conquerors, angered
with those who thus delayed their victory, butchered where they could
not put to flightss

l. 460. superantes, ‘howbeit they did force a few survivors to re-
treat.’ Dr. Arnold says, ‘ Then followed a butchery such as has no re-
corded equal‚ except the slanghter of the Persians in their camp, when
the Greeks forced it after the battle of Plataea.’

l. 463. tribunus militum. There were six in each legion, whose
duties were to keep order in the camp and generally superintend the
soldiers. They commanded in turn as colonels of the legion.

praetervehens. ‘Pratervehor‚' from constant use in the passive
of a rider, had come to be regarded as a deponent. Hence the present
, participle is here used in the sense of riding, though ⁴ veho ’ means ‘to
carry.'

1. 464. oppletum, ‘covered;' lit. filled up.

l. 465. respicere, ‘remember in your favour that you alone are
guiltless‚' δίε. This verb is rarely used in a bad sense.

1. 467. protegere, here, as before, used in its special sense of ‘to
shield.'

funestam, ‘do not make this battle a day of mourning by the
death of a consuL’ ‘F unestus’ implies a day when the State had a
personal loss.

1. 468. feceris. In good Latin the second person of the present con-
junctive is only found in prohibitions, which are directed to an assumed
subject, e. g. ‘ quum absit, ne requiras ; ' Gallice, on ne doit pas.

1. 470. macte . . . esto, ‘go on and prosper in your courage.‘
⁶ Mactus ’ only occurs in the vocative, or in the nominative used as the
vocative: macte or mactus esto. The vocative is perhaps to be
explained by attraction, as in Pe1sius, 5. 2,- :—
