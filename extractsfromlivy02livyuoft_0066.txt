l. 474. praeceptorum, i. e. not to fight. Aemilius Paulus' martyr-
dom certainly had its reward. The F abian policy was adopted after his
death.

1. 476. reim, ‘lest I have a second time to stand on my defence on
vacating my consulship.’ In 219 B. C. Paulus and M. Livius had finished
the Illyrian XVar, and had been charged afterwards with misappro-
priation of the spoils. Livius was fined, and retired into private life,
till he consented to come forward again and share with Claudius Nero
the glory of the battle of the Metaurus. Aemilius had been aequstted,

1. 477. crimine, ‘ by bringing a charge against another.'

l. 479. eos. The MSS. have ‘exigentes,' which would mean ‘accu-
rately examining.' But, as this is not what they were doing, Madvig

aristocracy, on the next their inborn spirit revived; and their resolute
will, striving beyond its present power, created, as is the law of oux
nature, the power which it required)
