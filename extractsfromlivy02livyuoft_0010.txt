the Romans, to keep on the same commander for any number of years.
It is hardly necessary to follow the stages of the first Punic War
(264—241). At first the Carthaginian fleet carried everything before
it; till the Romans built a fleet, and their general Regulus was even
able to carry on a campaign in Africa. At last he was taken and his
army destroyed; the Romans lost two fleets by storms; and the war
was again confined to Sicily. Roman patriotism determined to build
a third fleet, and with this fleet was at last established the ascendancy
of Rome on the sea. The final battle of the Aegates Islands was
fought, Sicily was given up, and became a Roman province. Carthage
was obliged to pay an enormous fine and could only bide her time, if
ever she wished to get her revenge. It was after this that the noble
family of the Barcidae shewed their indomitable patience while they
established a Carthaginian empire in Spain. They had two enemies to
sear, the peace party in Carthage, and the Romans. Hannibal, how-
ever, with marvellous judgment gradually kindled the war which he knew
it was his best poliey to bring on. When the Roman ambassadors came
to complain about Hannibal's treatment of Saguntum, they were met
with recriminations about Sardinia. Thus war was declared. Hannibal
was readyt with the utmost rapidity he led his army from the banks
of the Ebro to the banks os the Rhone, and from thence, in defiance os ·
Scipio, across the Little St. Bernard. It is not within the scope of this
little volume to trace his march, to picture the distress of his troops,
or to enlarge upon the sufferings of an advance which rival those of the
retreat of the French from Russia.

It is hoped that the omission of the intewening portion of history will
not lessen the interest of those beginners in Latin sor whom it is specially
intended. The following extracts from Livy do not profess to give more
than an account of Hannibal's four great vietories. The mature mind
seeks to know the causes and occasions of everything. To youth the
simplicity os ancient history is one of its greatest charms. Our memories,
by a process of natural selection, retain or reject respectively the more
or less striking facts of bygone ages. In reading this second Punic
War our sight is not dazzled by the blaze os light, our memories are not
burdened by the mass of names which modern correspondents shower
around the feats os their contemporaries. The consequence is that
we lose enormously in copiousness of detail. But we gain equally
in dramatic effect. Such lessons as we learn from Greece or Rome are
generally obvious; the characters which we read of have osten helped
