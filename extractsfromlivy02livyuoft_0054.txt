36 NOTES ΟΝ HANNIBAL'S CAMPAJGN.

of settling at Veii after the Gallie invasion. This had been checked by
a speech from Camillus,'and an omen from the gods‚—when the officer
osa regiment was passing through the forum at the moment of the debate,
—xvas heard to say, ‘ Signifer, statue signum ; hic manebimus optime.’

l. 210. moverimus, perfect used prohibitively, as generally in the
second person, ‘ nor let us once stir from hence, till,' &c.

1. 211. veiis; really from Ardea. His army was at Veii.

l. 212. convelli, ‘to be plucked up from the ground‚’ as decamping.

l. 213. equus, ‘the horse stumbled and fell, threw his rider over his
head, and there lay the consul of Rome on the ground.’

l. 218. senatu. See note on l. 289. So often had augury been
used by the senate to oppose Flaminius, that he had come to despise it
altogether. He therefore, the late censor, at once assigns a rationalistic
cause for the standard’s being immovable, and starts off to fight. One
can hardly help comparing his conduct with that of Fabius, who, with
equal disbelief, used current beliefs to help on his victory. Flaminius
‘put his sickle to the corn before it was ripe, and reaped only mischief
to himself and no fruit for the world.’ But the picture which Livy

l. 222. quo, ‘in order the more to whet the edge of the consul’s

1. 224. nata, ‘ made by nature for ambuscade.’

ubi maxime, ⁴ at the exact point where the lake nestles close under
the hills.'

l. 226. de industria, ‘purposely ;’ ‘ as if there had been left room
only for that purpose and nothing else.’

l. 228. in aperto, ‘on the clear space,‘ ‘ on the open ground.’

l. 2 31. locat, the historic present, here takes the past subjunctive.

l. 232. obiecto; ‘he might put forth his horsemen to oceupy the
neck of the glade, and all might thus be enclosed within the lake and the
rnountains.’ In other words, he barred the outlet with his infantry;
the entrance of the pass was to be closed by the cavalry, who advanced
behind the heights as soon as the Romans were well in.

ἲ. 2 33. essent, imperfect subjunctive.

l. 235. inexp1orato, adverb, ‘the morrow after, before it was full
daylight, without any reconnoitering, he made his way through the
pass, and as soon as his columns began to open out into the wider
ground, he saw only those enemies who were in front of him, whilst the
ambushes behind and above him were concealed from his notice.'

1. 2 38. So most editors sor deceptae, which is in the MSS. Madvig,
