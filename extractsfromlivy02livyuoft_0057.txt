divisions of the second line, equal in extent to a ‘manipulus,' were in

l. 281. senserit. ‘ None felt, not for a moment.’ Stronger than
‘sentiret.’

l. 283. infestior, ‘more openly hurtful.‘ ‘Insensus’ seems used to
express hostile disposition, ‘infestus’ hostile attack. Cp. ⁴ In ipsum

1. 289. cecidit. Flaminius had been consul in 223 B.C., and was already
in the field when the senate's scruples were aroused by prodigies. They
at once sent orders to recall him. He took the despatches, put them in

victory over the Insubres, he declared, when he did read the despatches‚
that the gods themselves had solved the senate's scruples, and that it
was needless to return.

1. 297. per omnia, ‘were the defile never so narrow, were the crags
never so steep, they marched blindly on, only to be dashed down, arms
and men together, one upon the other?

l. 300. prima, ‘ entering at the edge of the pool where it was

1. 301. fuere, ‘ some there were whom the heedlessness of sear urged
to take to ssight by swimming.’ For this poetic infinitive aster ‘ impello‚‘

Insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores
Impulerit ? ‘
