to supply our language. The sceptic who would try to prove Car·
thaginians honest has to compete with a belief which is sossilized in the
words ⁴ Punic saith? The reader who takes up a book labelled Hannibal
knows that he has to read the story of a man who was influenced by
one great hate, who waged sor some years a successful war against the
one power which was to save Europe's future, and who seemed to fail
only in arousing his countrymeu to efforts worthy os themselves in
their own interests. Even to this day he succeeds in attracting the
sympathies os posterity, though we know that his success would have
been the worst calamity that could have happened to all that we love
most.

But it is not only the distance of ages which lends this grand
enchanting simplicity to the second Punic War; the forces called into
play, the stage, the number of characters employed in the drama of
ancient warsare, have an unity about them which of necessity helps to
concentrate our interest. Is Hannibal‘s great effort had been spread
over Europe like Napoleon’s; if Rome and Carthage had met as rarely
single-handed on the same element as F rance and England; if, besides
the one great general, we had had to follow the somnies of a Massena
and a Murat, a Lannes and a Desaix‚ or to estimate the comparative
shares which a Moltke and a Bismarck had in bringing on the situation3
the story of Hannibal would not be what it is. It might have had
a different sequel, but Hannibal would not stand out as he does.

In speaking of the invasion of Italy, the parallel between Napoleon
and Hannibal is too real to be missed. The general resemblance of
Napoleon's campaign in Lombardy in 1796 or 1800 to that of Hannibal
in B.C. 216 is capable of being pressed in many ways. And so the
great Napoleon himself felt. Over and over again in his proclamations,
in his despatches, he compares himself to, or contrasts himself with,
Hannibal. The F rench soldiers os the first Army of Italy must have
known the names of the second Punic War. Hannibal won his spurs at
the siege of Saguntum, Napoleon at the siege os Toulon; neither of
them seems to have had patience for much siege work afterwards. The
army of each was trained in Spain. Each pointed out Italy to his
troops as the reward of all their labours, the latter specially reminding
his of Virgil's lines :—

‘ Videmus
Italiam. Italiam primus conclamat Achates:
Italiam laeto socii clamore salutant.⁷
