bank. These would soon be ‘overgrown with weeds, and briars, and
brushwood, with which, for the most part, such uncultivated spots are
clad.’ Polybius talks of ῥεῖθρόν τε, ἔχον ὀφρὺν, ἐπὶ δὲ ταύτης ἀκάνθας
καὶ βάτους συνεχεῖς ἐπιπεφυκότας. He adds that the Romans were
the more taken off their guard because there was no wood near, and
so they did not expect an ambush, whilst, on the othei· hand, it was
easier for Mago to see over reeds than it would have been through a wood.

perceived that it afforded cover enough even for hiding men on horse-
back,’ &c.

1. 108. corpora. curare, ‘to refresh ourselves.' The realistic cha-
racter of Latin expression, says Pons, in his ‘Hints,’ is shown by the
introduction of words like ‘corpora’ and ‘animos.’ Cf. ‘Ille morte
proposita facile dolorem corporis patitur.' So, too, where we say ‘ean’

Ramsay, Rom. Ant. p. 384.

1. 114. magoni, general dative of reference, ‘ for Mago's use or con-
venience.'

Cicero, ‘ Inicere tumultum civitati.'

rode without saddles. See note on l. j ς..

1. 122. tumultum, ‘a rising‚' then ‘an alarm,’ ‘ impetuous fight:’
