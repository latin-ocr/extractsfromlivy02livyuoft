INTRODUCTION.

THE Third Samnite XVar ended in the year 290 ac. and resulted in
the complete occupation of Samnium by Rome. The continued re-
sistance of the Samnites has been compared by Arnold to the fortitude
shown by La Vendee in resisting the Republican Convention during
the French Revolution. Heroic as it was, the resistance of Samnium
was at last crushed by the death of G. Pontius and the occupatiori of
Venusia as a military colony by 20‚000 Romans. The final reduction
of this part of Italy closes the first period of Roman history. If the
second decade of Livy’s history were still extant, the most interesting
portion would be the story of Pyrrhus, the adventurer King of Epirus.
and of his attempt to rival in the KVest what Alexander the Great had
done in the East. The story of the aged Appius Claudius going into
the senate house, escorted by his sons and sons-in—law‚ to protest against
the Romans making peace after the battle of Herakleia, might have read
like the episode in our own annals when Lord Chatham used his dying
voice to protest against England's yielding to France and America.
Appius’ harangue was successful : the Romans declined to make peace;
the battle of Beneventum was fought in 275 B.C. ; and the Carthaginians
lived to repent that they had taken part with the Romans instead of with
the Greeks. Had they thrown their forces into the scale of Pyrrhus’
sortunes, the battle of Beneventum might have had a different result.

But the Carthaginians had taken a totally different line os policy. In
the very heat of the war with Pyrrhus a Carthaginian fleet had appeared
off the coast os Latium and had offered assistance to the Romans. The
osser was then refused, but their gratitude remained. The two peoples
had sworn eternal sriendsffip, and in the year 275 Rc. no alliance could
have seemed more likely to last. In spite of this, two events led quite
surely to the inevitable conflict between Rome and Carthage. The first
was the subjugation of Tarentum, aster it had been held sor four years
by one os Pyrrhus’ generals; the second was the reduction of Rhegium,
where some rebellious soldiers of the eighth legion had taken refuge.
By these acts the Romans trenched on the. sphere of Carthaginian in-
