22 NOTES ΟΝ HANNIBAL'S CAMPAJGN.

l. 4. Maharbalem. Arnold calls Maharbal the best cavalry officer of
the best cavalry service in the world. It was he who aster the battle of
Cannae urged Hannibal to march on Rome, and when Hannibal refused,
Maharbal made the famous remark, ‘Vincere scis, victoria uti nescis.’
Livy, 21. 12. On the present occasion he seems to have been making
a reconnaissance in force, with the double object of concealing his gene-
ral's advance and of making friends among the Gauls. Scipio, how-
ever, by his advance, compels Hannibal to withdraw Maharbal at
once.

ala. (Cic. Orat. c. 45. ξ 153) for ‘ axilla? So ⁸ bruma’ for
‘ brevima ⁷ (the shortest day), ‘ carcer ’ from ‘ coarceo‚' ‘imus ’ for
‘infimus‚’ ‘mala’ for ‘maxillaff ‘ paullus’ sor ‘pauxillus,’ ‘velum’ for
‘vexillum‚’ and many others, infr. ll. 13. 33. These clipt forms are
emphatically the language of practical and busy men, who hurry through
their talking. The ‘ ala ’ was generally 500, sometimes 1000, strong.

l. 5. depopulandos, N. B. The gerundive attraction is almost in-
variable aster a preposition, and quite invariable after the accusative
with a preposition. Thus, such an expression as ‘in laudando victorem,'
must be avoided, and ‘ ad placandum deos’ is impossible. In English
the seeming participle present is really a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon
infinitive. In Latin the idea of the verb becomes so closely limited to the
object mentioned, that a combination is effected by making the object
take the case of the gerund and the gerund the gender and number of
the object. Thus, ‘equites tegendo ’ would become ‘ equitibus tegendis,'
unless the writer wished to keep the two ideas somewhat apart. ⁴ This
is a good place for a horse-show,’ would be undoubtedly ‘aptus est
locus equis monstrandis‚’ but ‘this is a good place for showing off a
gladiator’ might be, ‘gladiatorem monstrando?

l. 7. ponte perfecto. In translation break up the participial style of
Livy. ‘The bridge was now finished ; the army was led across into the
territory of the Insubres, and encamped five miles from Ictumulae,’ &c.
See Potts’ ‘ Hints,' p. 68.

l. 10. revocato, not ‘ revocatis? The order was given to Maharbal,
‘ Sent speedily sor Maharbal back again, and the horsemen.’

l. 1 1. instare, ‘ since he saw that a battle was imminent.‘

l. 1 3. contionem. ‘ Contio ' = ‘ conventi0,’ shortened form of ‘ coven-
tio: as ‘ nundinae ’ of ⁶ novemdinae,' ‘ nuntius’ possibly of ‘ noviventius.'
As we say ⁴ Covent Garden‚’ for ‘ convent‚’ ‘ Coblentz ' for ‘ confluente&
so here the ‘n’ drops out before ‘v.’ Translate, ‘He called them
together to an audience, where he promised openly to them definite
rewards, in the hope of which they might fight:
