20 NOTES ON HANNIBAL’S CAMPAIGN.

Messana, and after crossing the strait to go by land through the whole
length οἱ Italy, the soldiers being bound by oath to appear on a certain
day at Ariminum ’—a march which they accomplished in forty days.—
Amold, l. c. p. 94.

Polybius (iii. 6 5) gives the following account of the battle of Ticinus.
‘ On the next day (after Scipio had crossed the Ticinus) both armies were
marching along the river (the Padus), on the bank which is nearest the
Alps (i.e. the northern bank), the Romans with the stream on their left
(i. e. marching west), the Carthaginians with the stream on their right (i. e.
marching east). On the next day, discovering from their foragers that they
were near each other, they went into camp on the spot and there remained.
On the morrow each side called ont all the horse—and Scipio in addi-
tion the javelin men of his infantry—and advanced through the plain,
each anxious to spy out the forces of the other. As soon as they
approached each other, and saw the dust rising, they at once drew out
for battle. Scipio put his javelin men in sront, and the Gaulish cavalry
who were with them3 the rest of his force he ranged in line; and in
this order advanced slowly sorward. Hannibal drew up his bridled
horse and heavy cavalry opposite the enemy and advanced against him,
while he arranged the Numidian horse on either wing in order to sur-
round the Romans. As both the generals and the cavalry on each side
were eager for battle, the first shock was so severe that the javelin rnen
had hardly thrown their first weapons ere they retired and fled into
cover of their own horse, through the insterstices between the troops,
scared at the onset‚ and afraid lest they should be trampled down by
the charging cavalry. But the cavalry in the front who had met in the
charge fought an equal battle for a long time. And the conflict was at
once an engagement on horse and on foot, owing to the great number os
rnen who dismounted in the course of the struggle. But when the Numi—
dians came round and charged the Romans in the rear, the javelin men
who had at first escaped the shock of the horse, were trampled down by
the multitude of the charging Numidians. Those who had fought from the
first in the front with the Carthaginians, after losing many of their own
men, and slaying yet more of the Carthaginians, when the Numidians
set upon them in the rear, were put to flight ; some left the field as they
could, others in a compact body round their general?

Comparing this with our text, we see that the Roman historian has
spoiled the simple and intelligible narrative of Polybius, (1) by speaking
of the charge of Maharbal; (2) by the speech of Hannibal on the return
of Maharbal: (3) by the mention of the prodigies of the Roman camp.
On the other hand, Polybius does not mention the fact that Scipio was
