II. BATTLE OF THE TREBJA. 27

part of Hannibal. Under cover of the night he advanced to the Trebia
and the adjacent hills, where he would be in a strong position and sur-
rounded by allies of Rome (Polyb. iii. 67). Hannibal hearing of the
movement at once sent his Numidian horse, and then his heavy cavalry,
in pursuit; afterwards he followed with his army. The Numidiam,
finding the camp deserted, burnt it. This delay saved the Roman53
had the Numidians pressed on at once they would have caught the
Romans in the plain, and cut thern down. As it was the bulk crossed
the Trebia in safety3 only the rear was overtaken. Once across the
river, Scipio fortified a camp on the adjacent hills, waiting for his col-
league Sempronius. Hannibal now brought his camp within five miles
of the Romans, the Gauls supplying him liberally with provisions
(Polyb. l. c. 68).

Sempronius now arrives from Ariminum (p. 20), and joins Scipio. Han-

nibal meanwhile gains Clastidium, a town considerably to the west of
Placentia, by treachery, and is enabled to draw supplies from it. Then
he lays waste, with his Numidiam, the territory of some Gauls, inhabitants
of the regions between the Trebia and the Po, who after joining him had
thought to save themselves by sending an embassy to Scipio. The
Gauls fly to the Romans for refuge. Sempronius, who is eager to bring
on an engagement, sent a large body of cavalry and some javelin men on
foot across the river, and drove the Numidians back to their camp.
But Hannibal was not yet sully prepared, and would not risk a general
engagement. The Romans returned to their camp.
‹ In the next night Hannibal sent Mago to form an ambuscade in the
bed of a stream, between his camp and the Trebia, and on the next day
he sent his Numidian's to draw the Romans across the Trebia into a
battle.

That Livy regarded the battle as taking place on the Placentia
(eastern) bank of the Trebia is clear (see ll. 182-184), and there is
nothing in Polybius which compels us to contradict this. But the view
is not without difficulties. For (1) Sempronius marches to join Scipio
from the east, i.e. across the front of Hannibal’s position ; (2) Hannibal
draws his supplies from the west (Clastidium) ; (3) the Gauls whom he
harrics, who are on the opposite side of the river from the Roman camp,
dwell between the Trebia and the Po, an expression which is thought to
suit the western side of the river better than the eastern, for the river
runs N.E. (but see map, p. 3). This would indicate that the (second)
camp of the Romans was on the eastern bank, and the battle certainly
· took place on the side opposite to the camp. Nevertheless, it is impos-
sible to suppose that Livy did not know on which side os the river
