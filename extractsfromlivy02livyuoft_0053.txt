the battles of Montenotte and Dego put Nap'oleon in the year 1796.
In the words which follow the text in Livy, we are told that the Romans
who had been left in charge of the camp, and the wounded, crossed the
Trebia on rafts, the Carthaginians being too weary to attack them,

ΙΙΙ. DISASTER OF LAKE THRASYMENUS, Rc. 217.

l. 196. After the defeat on the Trebia Scipio retreated to Ariminum,
Sempronius to Etruria. Hannibal remained in Gaul, against his will,
sor the Gauls were impatient of supporting his army. In the next year,
217 B.C., C. Flaminius and Cn. Servilius Geminus were chosen eon-
suls. 1'1am1n1us, the people’s friend, had already been victorious
in Lombardy. He at once joined Sempronius' army in Etruria. Ser-
vilius took Scipio's place at Ariminum. ‘The harvests of Arretium'
were again in danger. Hannibal had erossed the Apennines suddenly,
and was on his way, not to Lueca by the sea-road, but towards the
upper valleys of the Arno, between Florence and the mountains. Whilst
Flaminius was still waiting at the terminus of the Via Cassia at Arezzo,
Hannibal encamped at Fiesole, after a march of four days, over ground
so wet that the troops had to rest by night on the field baggage and

‹ dead mules. Meanwhile Servilius remained on the terminus of the Via

Flaminia, recently made, at Ariminum. (Cf. ‘ The Second Punic War‚‘

enemy remained inactive. ‘All the more now, when, &e., did he take
the disgrace on himself, that, &c. In vain did all his counsellors‚ &c.
They reminded him, &c. He flung himself out of,’ &e.
