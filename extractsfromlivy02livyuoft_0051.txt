II. BATTLE OF THE TREBIA. 33

l. 146. incauti, ‘ charged at unawares,’ ‘taken at a disadvantagef
l. 147. peditibus is here the dative case.
l. 148. socium nominis Latini. Either, like ‘Patres conscripti,’

, “Fathers and conscripts,’ ‘allies and Latin name,‘ in which case the

allies would mean Italians not in the Latin name, or simply, ‘ allies of
the Latin name.' In the former case we should have here a case os
asyndeton, in the latter the genitive would be simply a genitive of
quality. The Latin name, as opposed to the Etruscan or Sabellian
and Campanian allies, denoted not only the members of the old
Latin union, like Tibur and Praeneste, but also those colonies which
were distributed through Italy with Latin rights, e. g. Circeii and
Ardea, Cora and Norba, Fregellae and Interamna, Sutrium and Nepete,
Cales, Suessa, and Saticula, Alba, Aesernia and Beneventum, Narnia
and Spoletum, Luceria and Venusia, Hadria and Firmum, and finally
Brundusium in the South and Ariminum in the North. All these
States had two privileges‚—(1) that every Latin who left a son behind
him to keep up his family might go to Rome and possess the fran-
chise; (2) that every Latin magistrate might at once be a Roman
citizen.

1. 150. At the Battle of Cannae there were eighty thousand engaged
on the side of the Romans, half burghers and half allies.

1. 151. obsisterent, ‘the legions resisted, owing to their greater
strength!

1. 152. diducta, ‘drawn off so as to reinforce the two wings! In
‹ other words, the slingers and light—armed troops left off fighting with
the legions and joined their cavalry on the wings, confining their atten-
tions to the Roman cavalry. These, already outnumbered, were soon
utterly overwhelmed.

l. 157. eminentes, ‘ standing out clear,' i. e. to left and right of the
horse.

1. 160. curatis. See note on 1. 108.

l. 161. contra, ‘ on the contrary, the Romans were fasting and weary,
and stiff and numbed with cold.’

1. 163. anim-is, ‘ still their courage would have helped them to with-
stand to the end if they had only had to fight with the foot.’

l. 168. in, ‘in the midst‚ however, of such a stress of misfortune on
all sides, the line remained sor some time unbroken.'

1. 170. velites, ‘ skirmishers‚' who fought in scattered parties where
required. They were armed with a buckler and a javelin, the iron ot
which was formed with a fine point, in order that it might be bent on
the first discharge, and thus rendered useless to the enemy.
