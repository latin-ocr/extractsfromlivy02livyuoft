left 3 the consul himself, at the head of his forces, was facing the flower
of Hannibal's insantry3 and the Numidian cavalry had closed the inlet.
The precise site of the battle has been much discussed. The evidence is
given very completely in W. Arnold’s edition of Dr. Amold's Second
Punic War, Note E. It seems pretty clear that the open plain between
Tuoro and the Lake is the ‘paullo latior campns’ of Livy. The van
of the Roman army may have been allowed to march towards Passig-

bius speaks of Flaminius leading his troops ‘along the lake into the
adjacent glen’ (παρὰ τὴν λίμνην εἷς τὸν ὑποκείμενον αὐλῶνα) we must
suppose that he alludes to the march past Borghetto into the ‘paullo
latior campus.’

alone kept his composure tolerably, considering how imminent was the
danger.’

tuming at the varied noises.’ ‘ Quoque ' abl. of ‘ quisque.’
