fluence in Italy. The whole extent of Italy, from the Macra and the
Rubicon to Rhegium and Brundusium, was now more or less subject to
Rome. A career of aggrandizement necessarily modifies the nation
which enters upon it. The overthrow of the Athenian empire changed
the habits and character of the Spartans. So the conquest of Italy had
a lasting effect on the aims and institutions of the Romans. The ten
years preceding the first Punic NVar (274—264 13.c.) increased the wealth,
enlarged the views, and changed the whole purpose of the Roman
republic. Amold sayS, ‘So passes away what may be called the
springtime of the Roman people. Wealth and power and dominion
have brought on the ripened summer, with more of vigour indeed but
less of freshness. Beginning her career of conquest beyond the limits
of Italy, Rome was now entering upon her appointed work, and that
work was undoubtedly sraught with good.'

The cause of the first conflict with Carthage‚ though inconsiderable
enough, shews clearly the aims of the Roman people. Sicily had now
come within the scope of their ambition. The Mamertines of Messana,
a horde of adventurers, were being punished by the Carthaginians sor
having attempted at Messana what the Romans had just forbidden
on their side of the strait at Rhegium. To save their independenee‚
they appealed, true to their Italian blood, to the Roman senate. The
Roman senate however, after long debate, refused to interfere. The
consuls Appius Claudius Caudex and M. Fulvius Flaccus then brought

” the matter before the people. The assembled tribes overruled the

authority of the senate. Polybius imagines that the people, oppressed
by debt‚ were anxious to enrich themselves with the plunder which the
sertility of Sicily and the riehes of Carthage promised. Is so they
reckoned very falsely. The Carthaginians were masters of the sea.
Rome had not a single ship of war. The generation which declared
war was sure to suffer severely. But in all probability the Roman equites
saw that sooner or later they must cross swords with the ‘ London os
antiquity,’ and they did not wish Messana to pass out of their own hands
meanwhile.

The Carthaginians were a commercial people, like the English; but.
unlike the English, they were dead to all feelings of honour in political
life. Their highest offices went to the highest bidder. Added to this
they were unwarlike and regarded money as a means of dispensing
with personal military service. They therefore employed mercenaries;
but, as their generals were not also magistrates, they were able, unlike
