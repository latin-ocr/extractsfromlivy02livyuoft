Il. BATTLE OF THE TREBJA. 29

muster at Ariminum, and that, however they managed to evade Hanni-
bal on the plains round Placentia, they did join Scipio's troopS.

Siciliae rebus. Sicily had been Sempronius' original province.
The senate had intended him even to attack Carthage from there.

l. 66. legens, ‘coasting.' The dangers of winter navigation in the
Adriatic are often alluded to by Horace. Cf. Od. 3. 3. 5.

‘Dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae.'

l. 70. declarabat, singular. Translate, ‘Now were both consuls
and the whole present force of the Romans opposed to Hannibal, so
as to make it quite clear that either with that power the empire of
Rome could be defended, or that all hope was gone.’ For the use of
the neuter, compare ‘ Romani regem regnumque Macedoniae sua futura
sciunt? The singular is here used as for one idea. Here the subject to
‘declarabat ' is the idea of matching. For a similar use of the participle,
compare ‘Angebant virum Sicilia Sardiniaque amissae,’ ‘the loss of
Sicily and Sardinia grieved the hero.‘ ‘Pudor non lati auxilii patres
cepit,’ ‘the fathers were ashamed of their refusal to help.' The Latin
language therefore avoids verbal substantives so far as possible.
‘Abstract words are of a scientific nature and presuppose education
in the reader. Oratory (and all Latin language is oratorical in its
character) appeals to the public, and consequently employs simple
phrases.’—Potts.

1. 72. minutus, ‘brought low‚’ ‘disheartened.’ So in Greek μινύ-
om. The opposite word is ‘ augeo,‘ eg. ‘tanta laetitia auctus sum, ut
nil constet.' Madvig suggests ‘admonituss on the ground that it is
not Latin ‘ minuere hominem‚’ but ‘ animum.’

recentis animi, ‘with his spirits quite fresh, and so feeling more
confident.’

1. 73. patiebatur, ‘ would brook no delay.'

l. 74. suum, ‘his own’ cavalry. Sempronius was proud of the fact
that his cavalry had not suffered the defeat of the Ticinus.

l. 76. sparsos, ‘coming suddenly on some of their detachments and
charging them at unawareS, as they were straggling and out of order,
and most of thern too laden with spoil.'

ad hoc, ‘ besides?

1. 77. Madvig reads inopinato for ‘ inopinatos‚’ which he maintains
can never be used for ‘ inopinantes.'

l. 79. stationes, ‘ sentries.'

unde, ‘beaten back from thence by the mere numbers of those
that swarmed forth, they waited for new succours and soon renewed the

fight.'
