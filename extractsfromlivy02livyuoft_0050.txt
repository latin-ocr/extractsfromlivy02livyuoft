32 NOTES ΟΝ HANNIBAL’S CAMPAIGN. ,

1. 124. destinato, ‘ being eager for fight, in accordance with his long
settled purpose.’

l. 126. nivalis, ‘the day was threatening sleet or snow.’ The time
being about mid-winter, and the day snowy and exceedingly cold.
Polyb. iii. 72, 3.

1. 127. ad hoc, ‘ moreover.’ See note on 1. 76.

1. 129. nihil, ‘there was no warmth left in them.'

l. 130. quicquid, ‘the more they approached the moist air of the
river? Here ‘quicquid’z‘quanto magis.‘ So, too, Livy says, at the
beginning os Book 31, after finishing the Second Punic War in his his-
tory, ⁴ Iam provideo animo, velut qui proximis litori vadis inducti mare
pedibus ingrediuntur, quicquid progredior, in vastiorem me altitudinem
ae velut profundum invehi.' In both ¹ progredior' and ‘appropinqua—
bant ’ there is a distinctly comparative sense. But in Catullus we have,

‘Ride, quicquid amas, Cato, Catullum,’
where ‘qiiicquid'=‘ as much as,' without any idea of an increasing
scale 3 aurae, dative after ‘appropinquabant.’

1. 133. aucta, ‘ and by reason of the rain which fell in the night it
had. been swollen breast high.'

utique, ‘ be it as it may‚’ ‘ in any case‚' restrictive and confirming.
‘ They were cold enough to start with, but when they were clean out of
the river, then most certainly, if not before, they were so numbed.’ It
is to be taken closely with the word preceding. Compare ‘ Velim Var-
ronis et Lollii mittas laudationes, Lollii utique ¹ (‘ in any ease Lollius’s ⁹).

l. 134. For corpora, compare l. 108, n. pot-entia, adj„ from ‘ potens.’

armorum. Here Livy uses the gerundive attraction. The expres-
sion ‘armorum potentes’ would be quite sufficient by itself. See note
on l. 5.

l. 138. per otium, ‘ at leisure.'

l. 142. quod virium, ‘ the very strength and manhood of his forces.‘

l. 143. ab cornibus may mean simply ‘ 011 the wings ;’ here, however,
it seems ‘ away from the wings‚' i. e. on the outer edge of the wingS‚ so
that the elephants were to the left of the cavalry on the left, and to the
right of the cavalry on the right (in utramque partem). See 1. 157.
[Polybius describes their position thus, iii. 72. 9, τὰ θηρία μερίσας πρὸ
τῶν κεράτων δι’ ἀμφοτέρων προεβάλετο, where δι’ ἀμφοτέρων seems to
mean ‘ between the infantry and cavalry.']

1. 145. consul. In translation be careful to break up this sentence.
‘ The cavalry were pursuing in disorder‚ when the Numidian horse
suddenly turned upon them. The Consul then gave the signal for
retreat, and, as they returned, posted thern on the flanks of his infantry?
