30 NOTES ΟΝ HANNIBAL’S CAMPAIGN.

l. 80. varia, ablative with ‘sequentes cedentesque.' Tr. ‘the fight
after this was variable, and although, at one time pursuing, at another
yielding‚ they had at the last made the contest pretty even, yet the
slaughter of the enemy was the greater, and so the tide of victory re·
mained with the Romans!

1. 83. maior iustiorque, ‘ no man, however, reckoned it as greater or
more natural than the consul himself?

1. 84. gaudio, ‘he was elated with joy that he had come off better
in that very arm of the service in which his colleague had come off
worse ; ’ i. e. on the Ticinus, when the cavalry was worsted.

1. 85. N. B. foret, in the sense of ‘ esset.' Generally ¹ forem' is only
used sor ‘essem’ in conditional or final language. Sallust, Livy, and
the poem, however, use it in the compound tenses exactly like ‘ essem.'
As a rule, ‘ forem ’ should never be used in Latin Prose except to mean
‘ would be,’ or after ‘ ut,’ ‘ne‚’ or ‘ qui,' expressive of a purpose.

restitutos ac refectos, ‘ comforted and refreshed.’

1. 87. dilatam; we should rather expect ‘differri,' but the perfect
passive osten expresses a will that something should be done; eg.
‘sociis maxime lex consultum esse vult.’

eum, ‘he, more sick in spirit than in body, with the meniory of
his wound still fresh, quaked to hear of a battle and arms.'

1. 89. sed, ‘ but they must not lose their vigour like a wounded man?

1. 90. differri, impersonal, ‘for why was there further delay or more
time wasted?’ A question in a long indirect speech is put in the infini-
tive, if the first or third person is employed in the direct, in the sub-
junctive, if the second. So the Romans say after the battle, ‘Duobus
consulibus, duobus consularibus exercitibus victis, quos ‘alios duces, quas
legiones esse, quae arcessantur?'

1. 95. forent. See note on 1. 85.

l. 98. paventes, ‘ cowering ' (palticiple after ‘videant ’). Nos object
to ‘videant.' Poenum subject to ‘secisse ' (infinitive after ‘videant').

l. 99. dicionis, possessive genitive, (ef. ‘ Ego totus Pompeii sum'),
‘ had brought under his own power?

l. 101. erat. Hannibal, aware of his opponent's eagerness, and
aware too that the days of his consulship were numbered, determines to
bring on an engagement. The Gauls, who served in both camps, were
equally ready to oblige either side with information.

rivus does not refer to the watercourse of the Trebia itself‚ but to
some tributary; of course the Trebia and its feeders would be much
more swollen in the spring, and, being a short stream, it would be sub-
ject to very sudden rises, which would make waste places on either
