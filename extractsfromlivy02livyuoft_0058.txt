40 NOTES ΟΝ HANNIBAL’S CAMPAIGN.

1. 302. capessere, ‘take to,' inehoative. So ‘facesso,’ ‘ Ι set about,'
‘lacesso‚' ‘I provoke,’ ‘ arcesso,' ‘ I send for.’

1. 303. immensa, ‘endlessss

1. 304. necquicquam, ⁴ after tiring themselves to no purpose.’

l. 307. primi, ‘vanguard.'

1. 311. nec, ‘nor yet.’ ‘ They could not know (by hearing) nor yet,
so dark was it, make out by sight?

1. 312. re. Mr. Potts, in his excellent ‘Hints towards Latin Prose
Composition‚' (page 30), illustrates the simplicity of the Roman style
by the use of the word ‘ res,’ which he likens to a blank cheque to be
filled up from the context to the requisite amount of meaning. Here
translate, ‘At last as the scale began to sink.’ For a long time ‘res
aequatae fuere‚' ‘ at last one side kieked the beam.’

1. 313. nebula, ‘the mist, dispelled by the gradually-increasing heat of
the sun, discovered the day.' Properly speaking, the mist hides the day,
but the Romans recognized the elaims of the negative agent as much as
of the positive. Compare Virg. Eel. 2. 26 :—

‘Quum placidum ventis staret mare.’
liquida, ‘ as the light cleared.’

l. 314. perditas res, ‘ utter havoc and foul discomfiture of the Roman
host.⁷

l. 321. Punica. The writer of the history of the Caudine Forks
ought to be more careful before bringing a charge of bad saith in the
matter of capitulation. It is obvious that the Romans could not help
themselves. Probably Maharbal had overstepped his powers in offex-ing
the terms he did. It would have been easy sor them to send to Han—
nibal who was close by. And Hannibal was aeting on a settled line
of policy in his treatment of Roman prisoners as opposed to Italian.

l. 3²3· coniecit. Note the abrupt change ol subject, and how awk-
ward it makes the sentence. Livy is generally more careful.

IV. THE BATTLE OF CANNAE, B.C. 216.

l. 324. consules. The death of Flaminius at Thrasymenus had
been followed by the defeat of part of Servilins' army, and the people
had, in their first alarm, elected a dictator for the defence os the city
itself, on which every one expected Hannibal would march at once.
'l'lieir clioice had fallen on Q. Fabius Maximus, a moderate aristocrat‚
and on M. Minucius Rufus (Livy, 22. 8, 6), sor on this occasion
